    dp1: '1. Data Protection at a Glance',

    dp2: 'General Information',

    dp3: `The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the EU Data Protection Directive of 1995. The General Data Protection Regulation particularly strengthens the rights of individuals with regard to personal data and at the same time tries to standardize data protection laws across Europe , regardless of where this data is processed. Data protection is a matter of trust and your trust is very important to us.`,

    dp4: `Of course we respect your privacy. Therefore, the protection of personal data and the legally compliant collection, processing and use of your data is an important concern for us. To ensure that you feel safe with us, we strictly adhere to the legal provisions when processing your data and would like to use this page to inform you about our data collection and use.`,

    dp5: `We have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent unlawful or unlawful processing of personal data and to prevent the loss, destruction or damage of them.`,

    dp6: `The following information provides a simple overview of what happens to your personal or non-personal data when you visit our website. Personal data are all data with which you could be personally identified. You can find detailed information on the subject of data protection in our data protection declaration below this text.`,

    dp7: `Data Collection on our Website`,

    dp8: `Who is responsible for the data collection on this website within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation?`,

    dp9: `The data processing on this website, the portal with its sub-pages accessible under "skess.de" is carried out by the website operator, Nils Hirsekorn IT.`,

    dp10: `The responsible body for the collection, processing and use of personal data is therefore`,

    dp11: `If you object to the collection, processing or use of your personal data in whole or in part, please send your objection to the responsible party by email, fax or letter.`,

    dp12: `How do we collect your data?`,

    dp13: `Your data is automatically collected by our IT systems when you visit the website. This is primarily technical data (e.g. internet browser, operating system or time of the page visit). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter our website. You can find details on the information collected below.`,

    dp14: `What do we use your data for?`,

    dp15: `We use the information provided to us to operate and provide our services; This also includes offering customer service and improving, repairing and customizing our services. The security aspect also comes into play here, since any misuse can also be determined via the technical system data. In order to understand how our users use our services, we analyze and use the information available to us to evaluate and improve our services, to research, develop and test new services and functions and to carry out activities to address problems or troubleshoot.`,

    dp16: `What does this mean specifically for you when you use our website?`,

    dp17: `The technical data (such as your IP address) is only saved as a session ID during your use of the website and is then deleted immediately.`,

    dp18: `When you access the portal or its sub-pages, the person responsible automatically records the information listed below, which your browser transmits to the person responsible - unless the relevant functions are deactivated. This data is only processed to ensure trouble-free operation, i.e. for the correct provision of the page you requested, but also to ensure the long-term functionality of the technical systems and to improve the offer. The legal basis for the survey is Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 lit. f GDPR. It is reserved to provide criminal authorities with data for the purpose of law enforcement if there is a legal obligation for the person responsible to do so.`,

    dp19: `Server log files`,

    dp20: `The person responsible automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us.`,

    dp21: `This data is not merged with other data sources.`,

    dp22: `This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interest in data processing according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR is based on our economic interest in the context of affiliate marketing.`,

    dp23: `The website operator has a legitimate interest in ensuring trouble-free operation, i.e. the correct provision of the page you requested, but also to ensure the long-term functionality of the technical systems and to make improvements to the offer - the server log files must be recorded for this. We reserve the right to make this data available to criminal authorities for the purpose of law enforcement if there is a legal obligation for the person responsible to do so.`,

    dp24: `This website uses functions of the web analysis service Matomo without setting tracking cookies.`,

    dp25: `Why is a Matomo without cookies a good idea?`,

    dp26: `In its much-debated judgment of October 1, 2019, the ECJ ruled that active, explicit consent must be obtained for every cookie that is not necessary for the operation of a website. This has to be done BEFORE the cookie is set. A succinct cookie banner that informs users that cookies are set is not sufficient.`,

    dp27: `So far, the `,

    dp28: `data protection authorities in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg`,

    dp29: ` have come to the conclusion that a self-hosted analytics service like Matomo, which does not send data to third parties and only collects anonymized / pseudonymized user data, does not require user consent. The prerequisite for this, however, is that Matomo is operated with "privacy-friendly default settings". The responsible body has ensured this here.`,

    dp30: `Order data processing`,

    dp31: `We have concluded a data processing contract with 1blu AG, Riedemannweg 60, D-13627 Berlin, in which we oblige 1blu AG to protect our customers' data and not to pass them on to third parties.`,
